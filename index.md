- After my last job I decided to take some time to update myself about the current state of blockchain. Facing with the DEFI ecosystem (gas wars, arbitrage bots, flash swap/loans, MEV, etc.), I learned and developed several personal tools/scripts that at some point and with a couple of tweaks was refactored to this real time transaction explorer for Uni V2, Sushi and Uni V3 with mempool transactions.
